# Machine-learning-of-Obstructive-jaundice-based-on-common-Laboratory-Tests-the-MOLT-model-
A collection of mahine learning models developed by R using mlr3 framework. With 57 common clinical features, it could help gain insights into obstructive jaundice with two models: one effectively distinguishes between benign and malignant causes, the other provides more naunced insights.

## Overview
The Machine Learning of Obstructive Jaundice based on Common Laboratory Tests (MOLT) model is a research project aimed at developing a machine learning model to predict obstructive jaundice based on common laboratory tests. The model utilizes a dataset of 57 features derived from laboratory test results, and it aims to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing obstructive jaundice more accurately and efficiently.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training the MOLT model consists of laboratory test results obtained from patients with various causes to obstructive jaundice. It includes 57 features, such as tumor markers, liver function tests, and other biochemical markers. The dataset used for external validation is provided along with the project for reference and verification purposes.

## Repository Structure
- `datasets/`: This directory contains the example dataset used for validating the MOLT model, along with documentation describing the dataset and its features.
- `models/`: This directory contains the trained machine learning models, including the MOLT binary classification model and the MOLT multiclass classification model.
- `scripts/`: This directory contains R scripts used for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `README.md`: This file provides an overview of the project, instructions for replicating the results, and contact information for the authors.

## Usage
To replicate the results of the MOLT model or use it for further research, follow these steps:
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `scripts/` directory and run the R scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
3. Refer to the documentation provided in the `datasets/` directory for information about the dataset and its features.
4. Experiment with different machine learning algorithms, hyperparameters, and feature engineering techniques to improve the performance of the model.
5. For any questions or inquiries, feel free to contact the authors.
